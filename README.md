This course is a natural progression of 6.00.1x and if you took that course, you will remember 
that it was an intense but rewarding experience. We are glad you are back with us for 6.00.2x! 
This document is a repeat of the course philosophy of 6.00.1x an
d w
e hope you will take th
e 
time to refresh yourself on the following points
. 
If you are just joining us for 6.00.2x, we hope 
that this document 
will give you a general feel for what you should expect in terms of 
workload, 
the course structure, and most importantly, what we hope you will get out of it.
This is a hard course. It is easy to get discouraged, but don’t!
As you 
will
noticed from the first 
assignment, there are many components and in order to successfully complete all parts, you 
have to:

understand the relevant su
btleties of the Python language

critically think about approaches to solve the problem

have good time management skills

pay close attention to deadlines
You have to put in many hours,
especially if you have never coded before
. The course 
description does 
say that no coding experience is necessary, but as with anything else, prior 
experienc
e will make it easier for you. We
am sure that students with no coding experience 
have completed the first assignment perfectly, but they probably put in a lot of work, a
sked 
questions, and after some frustrating but rewarding hours, managed to get the correct code. It 
is our intent that over the entire course, students should be able to get the work done in about 
10 hours a week.
If, on average, you are spending lots more
than that, let us know.
We encourage research and independent learning.
You may have noticed this now that we are 
two weeks into the course. This goes back to keeping this course on par with the MIT campus 
one. Independent research comes in many forms.
But ultimately, it comes down to paying 
attention, repetition of the concepts, and practice practice practice!
Your research can be done 
in many forms:

try out code in your Python developme
nt environment (Canopy, IDLE, or
whatever)

read the Python documen
tation or other Python tutorials

use a paper and pencil to sketch out solutions

if you have the textbook, read the relevant sections

post to the forums
This course does not aim to just teach programming.
We also teach computational methods.
As such, we may not cover every detail of the Python language. Otherwise, this would become 
a course on “Introduction to Python”, which it is not. 
If you are unfamiliar with Python, we 
have 
posted 
many Python resources available
online
. The forum 
participants, staff, and community 
TAs are also willing to help you if you have a question about certain Python constructs.
